# Website Name-CourseHub

Mini project on PHP

This website offers paid courses for domains such as IT & Software, Data Science, AI/ML, Digital Marketing, etc. The user has to first signup to create an account. After that user has to log in to add courses to the cart & purchase the courses. The user can also use remember me functionality to save the credentials in their browser so that they don't have to fill it again when logging again. The remember me functionality is implemented using cookies. The add-to-cart functionality is implemented using a session. I have used Razorpay as a payment integration for testing payments. The database has 3 tables: courses, customers & orders.
