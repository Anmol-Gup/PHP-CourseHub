Mini project on PHP

# Website Name-CourseHub

This website offers paid courses for domains such as IT & Software, Data Science, AI/ML, Digital Marketing, etc. The user has to first signup to create an account. After that user has to log in to add courses to the cart & purchase the courses. The add-to-cart functionality is implemented using a session. I have used Razorpay as a payment integration for testing payments. The database has 3 tables: courses, customers & orders.
